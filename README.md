This is our project for DIT2123 Object Oriented Modelling for April 2024 in Sunway College using java swing and MVC design pattern. This is an airport kiosk check-in system. Users can check-in through the kiosk or physically in a staff counter, where the kiosk will direct the user to their designated counter. While using the kiosk to check-in, users enter the already setted up booking number, passport number, and full name, that is currently in the Utils class, as it does not use a database. The program will give the respective the warning such as empty booking number, passport number, fullname, or invalid booking number, passport number, full name, or unanswered bag check-in security questions. Not only that, it also keeps track of the booking numbers that are checked in, and won't allow the same booking number to be checked in twice concurrently, or at a different time. Furthermore, the booking number can be locked, if the user inputs the wrong answer for the bag-check in security question. It is capable of checking in one person, or multiple people at once.
